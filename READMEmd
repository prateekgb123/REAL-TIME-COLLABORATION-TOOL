CollabSpace-Real-Time Collaboration Tool--

CollabSpace is a real-time document collaboration tool built using the MERN stack and Socket.io.
It allows multiple users to join the same room, edit a document together in real time, and see who else is currently present — similar to how collaborative editors work.

1. What This Project Does:-

-Users can create or join a room using a Room ID
-Multiple users can edit the same document at the same time
-Changes appear instantly for everyone in the room
-Documents are automatically saved to MongoDB
-Active users in the room are displayed in the header
-This project focuses on real-time communication, multi-user state management, and clean UI design.

2. Tech Stack:-

Frontend-

1.React.js
2.React Quill (rich text editor)
3.Socket.io client
4.Custom CSS

Backend-

1.Node.js
2.Express.js
3.Socket.io
4.MongoDB
5.Mongoose

3. How It Works:-

-A user enters their name and a room ID.
-The frontend connects to the backend using Socket.io.
-The backend adds the user to that room.
-The document content is loaded from MongoDB (or created if it doesn’t exist).
-When a user types, changes are emitted to the server.
-The server broadcasts those changes to other users in the same room.
-The document is auto-saved every few seconds.
-When someone leaves, the user list updates automatically.

5. Running the Project Locally:-

Step 1 - Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd collabspace

Step 2 - Setup backend
cd backend
npm install
Create a .env file:
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
Start backend:
npm start

Step 3 - Setup frontend

8. Why I Built This

-This project was built to understand:
1.Real-time communication using WebSockets
2.Managing shared state across multiple users
3.Handling presence tracking
4.Integrating MongoDB persistence
5.Designing a clean, usable interface
